> Cloud Attack Simulator & Responder — a safe, local/cloud testbed to simulate common cloud infrastructure attacks (brute-force, port scans, basic exploit attempts) and test detection/response pipelines. **For lab/testing use only.**

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project simulates attack traffic and demonstrates detection + automated response workflows. It’s designed as a defensive research tool and learning platform for:
- generating synthetic attack traffic and logs,
- evaluating detection models and rules,
- visualizing alerts in a dashboard,
- experimenting with automated response playbooks.

---

## ✅ Features
- Attack traffic generator (brute-force, port scan, custom patterns)  
- Detection engine (ML + rules-based)  
- Log generator and ingestion pipeline  
- Tkinter / web-based dashboard for real-time visualization  
- Configurable responder (auto-block IPs, raise alerts, log events)  
- Modular: swap detection model, add new attack scenarios

## ⚠️ Important — Legal & Safety
**Only** run this tool in isolated lab environments or on infrastructure you own or have written permission to test. Do **not** run simulations against third-party or production systems.

---

## 🚀 Quick start (local)
1. Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/cloud_attack_simulator.git
cd cloud_attack_simulator

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the generator (example):

python generator/run_generator.py


Start detector (example):

python detector/run_detector.py


Open dashboard:

python dashboard/app.py


(Adjust file names to match your implementation.)

🛠 Configuration

config.yaml — centralizes settings (log paths, thresholds, response actions).

detector/models/ — place trained models (or use packaged/demo models).

dashboard/config.json — dashboard settings (ports, refresh rates).

🧪 Example workflow

Start the detector and dashboard.

Launch generator to create a port-scan attack.

Detector flags suspicious behavior and triggers responder to block IP.

Dashboard shows alert and timeline of events.

📦 Requirements

Create requirements.txt with the libraries you use (example below):

scapy
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
flask      # if you use a web dashboard
matplotlib
PyYAML


Generate actual requirements.txt after you set up the venv with pip freeze > requirements.txt.

🧩 Extending the project

Add new attack scenarios (DDoS patterns, complex multi-step attacks).

Integrate with cloud APIs (use only with test accounts).

Replace detection with deep learning models.

Add alerting integrations (Slack, Email, SIEM).
